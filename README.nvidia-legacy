Nvidia legacy binary driver (390.xx series) is included
in this tree.  It is split into two packages (listed
in build order):

  x/nvidia-driver-390xx
  k/kmod-nvidia-390xx

First package contains libraries, binaries, config files
and X.org support - basically everything besides kernel
integration. Second one is the kernel module itself.
