Nvidia legacy binary driver is included in this tree.
It is split into two packages (listed in build order):

  x/nvidia-driver
  k/kmod-nvidia

First package contains libraries, binaries, config files
and X.org support - basically everything besides kernel
integration. Second one is the kernel module itself.
