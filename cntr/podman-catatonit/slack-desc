# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

podman-catatonit: of other container inits like tini and dumb-init.
podman-catatonit: This version integrates itself with podman by putting its binary in
podman-catatonit: podman's default helper search path.
