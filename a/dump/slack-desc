# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

dump: dump (tools for backing up and restoring ext2/3/4 filesystems)
dump:
dump: The dump package contains both dump and restore. Dump examines files
dump: in a filesystem, determines which ones need to be backed up, and
dump: copies those files to a specified disk, tape or other storage medium.
dump: The restore command performs the inverse function of dump; it can
dump: restore a full backup of a filesystem. Subsequent incremental backups
dump: can then be layered on top of the full backup. Single files and
dump: directory subtrees may also be restored from full or partial backups.
dump: Both static and dynamically-linked versions are included.
